# Technology Background

After seeing a Perl script that a co-worker had developed, and adding to that, when Ruby came around in '04, software was, say the least, at the top of my priority list.
I completed my Bachelors in 2014, attended GA in 2015, and have worked in software since 2016. Previously I worked as IT manager in healthcare.

Additionally, I have worked professionally in communications engineering, municipal network projects, academia, high-speed data storage nVMEoF, marketing and e-commerce, online payment systems with Authorize.net and Stripe, DoJ, mortgage & finance, cyber-security, and web-hosting.
