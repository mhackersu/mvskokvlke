Hi, name name is Mike Hacker. I am an indigenous software engineer, a Muscogee-Creek citizen, and DevX advocate.

I am currently researching the following topics in the first-peoples/first-nations context:

- The medicine wheel and native medicine in a modern world
- The importance of the Buffalo in our world
- Leadership Development and my thoughts on Braiding Sweetgrass
- Blood Quantum, Re-Birth, and the future of the Native Peoples
- The intersection of Cultural Identity & Native Identity
- Maps & Geography
- Land Exploitation & Reparations
- Appreciating LGBTQ+ contributions from the Two Spirit concept in First Nations

I started working in technology professionally in the mid-nintes and worked full-time on the data-center side of IT academia, telco, and healthcare. In the early zeros, I started to become interested in the software side of things such as Ruby and Rails, and by the mid-zeros was building business applications and websites for myself and friends.

By the mid-tens, I had completed my Bachelors in Buisiness Information Systems, joined General Assembly in Austin, TX, and attended the first cohort for the web development immersive. I was drawn to the GA program because of the focus on Ruby in the course work, and since GA, I have learned to appreciate JS as a "language".

Since the mid-tens, I worked in various positions in fire & safety, academia, computer hardware manufacturing, marketing, e-commerce, online retail, government software, mortgage & finance, cyber-security, and web-hosting.

I am a amateur radio enthusiast. My call is KI5IBD, and I spend my free time as a hobby meteorologist.
