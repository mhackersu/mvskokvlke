# Technology Background

I started working in IT professionally in the mid-nintes and have worked full-time on the data-center side of IT academia, telco, and healthcare. In the early zeros, I started I started to develop interest in the software side of things and after seeing a co-worker create a Perl script for some scheduling automation; After becoming briefly distracted by .Net I discovered Ruby in 2008 and immediately fell in love. By the mid-tens, I had completed my Bachelors in Buisiness Information Systems, and in 2015 graduated from General Assembly in their first cohort in Austin Texas. I was drawn to the GA program because of the inclusion on Ruby syntax, and since GA, I have learned to additionally appreciate JS as a "language". Since the mid-tens, I have worked in various software engineering positions across various industries including municipal network and communications engineering, academia, high-speed data storage, marketing and e-commerce, DoJ, mortgage & finance, cyber-security, and web-hosting.
