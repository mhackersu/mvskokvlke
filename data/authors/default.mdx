# Technology Background

I started working in technology professionally in the mid-nintes and worked full-time on the data-center side of IT academia, telco, and healthcare. In the early zeros, I started to become interested in the software side of things such as Ruby and Rails, and by the mid-zeros was building business applications and websites for myself and friends. By the mid-tens, I had completed my Bachelors in Buisiness Information Systems, joined General Assembly in Austin, TX, and attended the first cohort for the web development immersive. I was drawn to the GA program because of the focus on Ruby in the course work, and since GA, I have learned to appreciate JS as a "language". Since the mid-tens, I worked in various positions in fire & safety, academia, computer hardware manufacturing, marketing, e-commerce, online retail, government software, mortgage & finance, cyber-security, and web-hosting.
