title: Method Sets & Giving Abilities to Robots using Go

summary: In Go, understanding method sets helps you know how to properly give your robots (or any other objects) their abilities and how to use those abilities correctly. Itâ€™s like knowing which remote control works with which toy! So, your toy robots (structs) can do different things (methods), and whether you give them abilities directly or through a special key (pointer) changes how you can use those abilities.

### Why It Matters

Let's imagine you have a bunch of toy robots, and each robot can do different things like walk, talk, or dance. In Go, which is a programming language, we can make these robots and tell them what they can do by using something called "method sets."

### Robots and Their Abilities

1. **Robot Struct**: First, we create a basic robot model. Think of this like a blueprint for building robots.

```go
type Robot struct {
    name string
}
```

2. **Methods**: Methods are like the abilities we give to our robots. For example, walking and talking.

### Giving Abilities to Robots

Now, let's give our robots the ability to walk and talk by writing methods.

```go
func (r Robot) Walk() {
    fmt.Println(r.name, "is walking!")
}

func (r Robot) Talk() {
    fmt.Println(r.name, "says hello!")
}
```

### Method Sets

A method set is like a list of all the abilities a particular robot has. There are two kinds of method sets based on how we give robots their abilities:

1. **Value Receiver Method Set**: This is when we give abilities to a robot itself.

```go
func (r Robot) Dance() {
    fmt.Println(r.name, "is dancing!")
}
```

With value receiver methods, you can call them on both robot objects and pointers to robot objects.

```go
robot1 := Robot{name: "Robo1"}
robot1.Walk()  // Robo1 can walk
robot1.Dance() // Robo1 can dance

robotPtr := &robot1
robotPtr.Walk()  // Robo1 can still walk
robotPtr.Dance() // Robo1 can still dance
```

2. **Pointer Receiver Method Set**: This is when we give abilities to the robot through a pointer. A pointer is like a special key that points directly to the robot, making changes directly to it.

```go
func (r *Robot) Sing() {
    fmt.Println(r.name, "is singing!")
}
```

With pointer receiver methods, you can only call them on pointers to robot objects.

```go
robot1.Sing()   // This won't work
robotPtr.Sing() // This will work, Robo1 can sing
```

### Summary

- **Value Receiver Methods**: Abilities (methods) that the robot itself can use. Can be called on both robots and their pointers.
- **Pointer Receiver Methods**: Abilities (methods) that need a special key (pointer) to work. Can only be called on pointers to robots.
