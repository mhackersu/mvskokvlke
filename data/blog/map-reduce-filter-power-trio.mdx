## Transform Data with Map:

```
const mappedArr = array.map(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg]);
```

The map method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. It is used when you want to transform each element of an array in a consistent way.

## Return a single value with Reduce:

```
const reducedVal = array.reduce(callback(accumulator, currentValue[, index[, array]])[, initialValue]);
```

The reduce method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value. It is often used to accumulate values or transform an array into a single value, like a sum, product, or an object.

## Create a new array with all computed elements with Filter:

```
const newArr = array.filter(callback(element[, index[, array]])[, thisArg]);
```

The filter method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. It is used when you want to extract a subset of elements from an array based on a condition.

## These methods can be chained together.

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const result = numbers
  .map(number => number * 2)           // Step 1: Double each number
  .filter(number => number > 5)        // Step 2: Keep numbers greater than 5
  .reduce((sum, number) => sum + number, 0);  // Step 3: Sum the remaining numbers
console.log(result); // Output: 24
```
