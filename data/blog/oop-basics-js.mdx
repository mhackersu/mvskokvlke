summary: From an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) standpoint, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` in JavaScript cover several fundamental principles and patterns. Hereâ€™s a look at how these functions align with OOP concepts.

Understanding the native JS functions map, filter, and reduce can help bridge the gap between functional programming and OOP, while providing a robust toolkit for managing and manipulating data in JavaScript.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is about bundling the data with the methods that operate on that data. In the context of `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, arrays encapsulate both the data and the methods that manipulate the data. This allows you to work with arrays in a more abstract and higher-level way.

#### Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2) // `map` method is encapsulated within the array
```

### Abstraction

Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts. `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` abstract the iteration logic, providing a simpler and more declarative interface for common operations on arrays.

#### Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0) // Abstracts the loop and condition
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows methods to be used on different types of objects or in different scenarios. While `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are array-specific, their usage can be seen as a form of polymorphism where the same method (like `map`) can perform different transformations based on the provided callback function.

#### Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const strings = ['1', '2', '3', '4']
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num * 2)
const parsedStrings = strings.map((str) => parseInt(str, 10)) // Same method, different operations
```

### Higher-Order Functions

While not strictly an OOP concept, higher-order functions are closely related to the idea of objects with methods (behaviors). `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are higher-order functions because they take other functions (callbacks) as arguments.

#### Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const squared = numbers.map(function (num) {
  return num * num
}) // Passing a function to `map`
```

### Reusability and Composition

One of the OOP goals is to create reusable and composable code. `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` facilitate this by allowing you to define small, reusable functions that can be passed to these methods, enabling complex operations through function composition.

#### Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const double = (num) => num * 2
const isEven = (num) => num % 2 === 0
const sum = (acc, num) => acc + num

const result = numbers.map(double).filter(isEven).reduce(sum, 0) // Functions composed together
```

### Method Chaining

Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. This is a pattern commonly seen in OOP and is facilitated by `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` returning new arrays or values, allowing chains of operations.

#### Example:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const result = numbers
  .map((num) => num * 2)
  .filter((num) => num % 3 === 0)
  .reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0) // Chaining methods together
```

### Conclusion

In summary, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` embody several core OOP principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Arrays encapsulate data and related operations.
- **Abstraction**: They abstract the iteration and transformation logic.
- **Polymorphism**: They can perform different operations based on the provided callbacks.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: They take functions as arguments, enabling flexible behavior.
- **Reusability and Composition**: They promote the use of small, reusable functions and function composition.
- **Method Chaining**: They support method chaining for clean, readable code.
