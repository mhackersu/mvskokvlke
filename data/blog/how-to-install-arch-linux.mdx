Getting Started

Set aside some time. Getting Arch going at first is somewhat of a complex set of procedures and success will be largely determined by the quantity of time and grit that you can muster to accomplish the task. As a pure open-source thing, there is a certain liberation from all the marketing jazz with products these days, that said, there is not an instruction manual per se, or any guarantees or warranties, Arch is very much a choose your own adventure type experience, there are just so many decisions to be made, there are just so many assumptions not made, that’s what makes it beautiful. Well that and how it manages dependencies and updates with pacman, but we’ll get into that more in a bit. There is something almost magic about how the community works; It’s really an incredible feat to experience that something like this could almost self-organize. I recommend getting comfortable with git and pacman and establishing a solid innate knowledge of those tools first, then jumping into AUR Helpers like Yet Another Yogurt yay which also happens to be written in Go.

Arch is a stable Linux experience for a few reasons. Arch Linux does not really impose any opinions or preferences on the user experience, in fact it is quite the opposite, the user has to explicitly define everything. This is where Arch Linux can seem to have a steep learning curve, initially, however, once the steep learning curve is complete, Arch Linux is not only a stable and reliable experience, but it can bring the joy of computing back to the user experience.

Want to try it out for yourself? Great! Let’s get started!

Later on, I’ll be posting on setting up video conferencing going, an audio app, calendar, email, web browser, password management for Arch. Sign up to get notified when I publish new content.

Let’s get started!

First, download the Arch Linux ISO and create bootable USB drive.

Second, boot from the USB and connect to the internet using iwctl

iwctl --passphrase "PSK" station wlan0 connect "SSID"

Storage

sdX is a generic reference. Use your device name here. (eg.nvme0n1, etc.)

Display Storage Devices

$ lsblk

-- and/or --

$ fdisk -l

Shred Storage Device

$ shred -v -n1 /dev/sdX

Partitioning Tools

**_ Less Interactive _**
$ gdisk /dev/sdX

**_ More Interactive _**
$ cfdisk /dev/sdX

Partitions

EFI System Partition

/dev/sda1

512 MB
Partition Type - FAT32
Space for boot loaders and other files required for booting.

Swap Partition

/dev/sda2

4GB
Partition Type - Linux Swap
Swap space is used to extend the virtual memory beyond
the installed physical memory (RAM) or for suspend-to-disk support.

Linux Partition

/dev/sda3

Remaining size of disk
Partition Type - Linux Filesystem
This is the root (/) partition where Arch Linux operating system,
files, and other information will live.

Format Partitions

sda1… is a generic reference. Use your device name here. (eg.nvme0n1, etc.)

EFI Partition

mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1

Swap Partition

mkswap /dev/sda2
swapon /dev/sda2

Root Partition

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3

Install Distro

Generate fstab

mkdir /mnt/etc
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
cat /mnt/etc/fstab

Switch to Installed Root Partition

arch-chroot /mnt

Locale Setup

Timezone

127.0.0.1 localhost
::1 localhost
127.0.1.1 archy

Set Root Password

passwd

Add User

useradd -m -g users -s /bin/bash {username}
passwd {username}

visudo

## User privilege specification

root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
{username} ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

exit
login
{username}
pacman -Syy

Bootloader

# Install Grub Bootloader and EFI Boot Manager Packages

pacman -S grub efibootmgr os-prober mtools

# Create mount point for /dev/sda1 and mount

mkdir /boot/efi
mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi

# Install Bootloader

grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=grub_uefi

# Generate grub.cfg

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Reboot

# Exit chroot

exit

# Unmount everything

umount -R /mnt

# Reboot

shutdown now -r

Configure Network

Check Driver Status

lspci -k | more

Get the name of the interface

Generate WPA Supplicant Config File

wpa_passphrase MYSSID passphrase > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

---

update_config=1
network={
ssid="SSID"
psk="PSK"
mesh_fwding=1
}
