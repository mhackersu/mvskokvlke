Here's a cheat sheet for HTTP methods that you can reference when working with URLs, APIs, and web development:

### HTTP Methods Cheat Sheet

#### 1. **GET**

- **Purpose**: Retrieve data from the server.
- **Safe and Idempotent**: GET requests should not alter the state of the server. Itâ€™s idempotent, meaning multiple identical GET requests will have the same effect.
- **Common Use**: Fetching data or resources (e.g., web page, API data).

**Example**:

```http
GET /users/123
```

#### 2. **POST**

- **Purpose**: Submit data to the server to create a resource or trigger an action.
- **Not Idempotent**: Each POST request can result in a different outcome (e.g., creating multiple resources).
- **Common Use**: Sending form data, uploading files, creating a new resource.

**Example**:

```http
POST /users
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

#### 3. **PUT**

- **Purpose**: Update or replace a resource on the server.
- **Idempotent**: Multiple identical PUT requests should have the same effect.
- **Common Use**: Replacing a resource with new data.

**Example**:

```http
PUT /users/123
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "name": "John",
  "email": "newjohn@example.com"
}
```

#### 4. **PATCH**

- **Purpose**: Partially update a resource on the server.
- **Not Idempotent**: Can be idempotent but typically not required to be.
- **Common Use**: Updating a resource with partial information (e.g., changing just one field).

**Example**:

```http
PATCH /users/123
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "email": "newemail@example.com"
}
```

#### 5. **DELETE**

- **Purpose**: Remove a resource from the server.
- **Idempotent**: Repeated DELETE requests on the same resource will have the same effect (i.e., the resource is deleted).
- **Common Use**: Deleting a resource, such as a user or file.

**Example**:

```http
DELETE /users/123
```

#### 6. **HEAD**

- **Purpose**: Retrieve the headers of a resource without the body.
- **Safe and Idempotent**: Similar to GET, but it only fetches headers and not the actual content.
- **Common Use**: Checking metadata about a resource, such as content type or modification date.

**Example**:

```http
HEAD /users/123
```

#### 7. **OPTIONS**

- **Purpose**: Describe the communication options for the target resource.
- **Safe and Idempotent**: It does not modify the resource.
- **Common Use**: Discovering allowed methods (GET, POST, etc.) and supported features of an API endpoint.

**Example**:

```http
OPTIONS /users/123
```

#### 8. **CONNECT**

- **Purpose**: Establish a tunnel to the server, typically for HTTPS.
- **Not commonly used in REST APIs**.
- **Common Use**: Used in setting up a proxy server connection or SSL tunneling.

**Example**:

```http
CONNECT example.com:443
```

#### 9. **TRACE**

- **Purpose**: Perform a diagnostic trace of the path to the target resource, often used for debugging.
- \*\*Not typically used in production environments for security reasons.
- **Common Use**: Diagnostic tool to view request/response behavior, though not common in APIs.

**Example**:

```http
TRACE /users/123
```

### Additional Tips:

- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: Certain HTTP methods (like PUT, DELETE) may require proper CORS configuration when making cross-origin requests from the browser.
- **Content-Type**: Specify the format of the data you're sending (e.g., `application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, etc.).
- **Authorization**: Many APIs require authentication tokens (e.g., JWT tokens) for methods like POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### Using Methods with `<a href>` in HTML

You can only use GET with the `<a>` tag in HTML. To perform other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE), you typically use JavaScript and frameworks like jQuery or fetch API.

```html
<!-- GET method (default behavior) -->
<a href="/users/123">View User</a>

<!-- POST method (using JavaScript) -->
<form action="/users" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Enter Name" />
  <button type="submit">Create User</button>
</form>

<!-- DELETE method (using JavaScript) -->
<button onclick="deleteUser(123)">Delete User</button>
<script>
  function deleteUser(id) {
    fetch(`/users/${id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
    })
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => console.log('Deleted:', data))
  }
</script>
```
