summary: Ubuntu has a recovery mode that you can use to reset a password or troubleshoot issues. Here's how to access it and reset your password.
---

### 1. Boot into Recovery Mode
1. **Restart your computer**.
2. As the system boots, hold down the **Shift key** (or press **Esc repeatedly** on UEFI systems) to access the GRUB menu.
3. In the GRUB menu, select the option labeled **Advanced options for Ubuntu**.
4. From the submenu, select a kernel with **(recovery mode)** appended.

### 2. Access the Root Shell
1. When the recovery menu appears, select **root - Drop to root shell prompt**.
2. You’ll be prompted with a command-line interface as the root user.

### 3. Remount the File System with Write Permissions
The root filesystem is mounted as read-only in recovery mode. To change it to read-write, enter:
```bash
mount -o remount,rw /
```

### 4. Reset Your Password
To reset the password for a user account, type:
```bash
passwd username
```
Replace `username` with your actual username. You’ll be prompted to enter a new password.

### 5. Update Permissions (if needed)
If you encounter permission issues, update file permissions with:
```bash
chmod 640 /etc/shadow
```

### 6. Reboot the System
Once done, reboot the system:
```bash
reboot
```

### Tips:
- If the above fails due to encryption or other security settings, you might need additional troubleshooting.
- Always ensure you remember your passwords or have a recovery mechanism in place.
