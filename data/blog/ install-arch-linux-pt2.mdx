# Install Arch Linux Pt.2 WIP

# **Time & Date via systemd-timesyncd**

_systemd-timesyncd_ is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as [chrony](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Chrony) or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. Unless you intend to serve NTP to networked clients or want to connect to local hardware clocks this simple NTP client should be more than appropriate for most installations.

```
/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
[Time]
NTP=0.arch.pool.ntp.org 1.arch.pool.ntp.org 2.arch.pool.ntp.org 3.arch.pool.ntp.org
FallbackNTP=0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org 0.fr.pool.ntp.org

```

```
systemctl start systemd-timesyncd.service
systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd.service
systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd.service
systemctl status systemd-timesyncd.service

```

```
timedatectl status
timedatectl set-ntp true
timedatectl timesync-status

```

# **Set Timezone**

```
tzselect

# Set timezone globally on localhost
sudo ln -sT /usr/share/zoneinfo/Country/TimeZone /etc/localtime

# Sometimes you'll need to remove the existing /etc/localhost
sudo rm -rf /etc/localhost

# Output current time according to timezone
date

# Set timezone for user only
echo "TZ='Country/TimeZone'; export TZ" >> $HOME/.profile

```

[Unable to change time-zone properly, the time is still from the previous time-zone](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/297577/unable-to-change-time-zone-properly-the-time-is-still-from-the-previous-time-zo)

# **Swap Caps with Escape (Currently supported by X11 only)**

`setxkbmap -option caps:swapescape`

- `caps:none` to deactivate
- `caps:escape` to make it an additional escape
- `caps:super` to make it an additional super (windows) key

## **Audio**

`sudo pacman -S pro-audio`
