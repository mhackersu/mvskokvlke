This article discusses the concept of "shifting left" in the context of microservices maturity adoption. It explores the benefits and challenges of adopting microservices maturity practices early in the development process, emphasizing the importance of proactive approaches to ensure success. Through a detailed examination of this strategy, the article aims to provide insights into how organizations can effectively leverage microservices maturity models to enhance their development lifecycle and overall operational efficiency.

# Introduction

In the fast-paced world of software development, staying ahead often means embracing new methodologies and practices. One such approach gaining traction is "shifting left" with the early adoption of microservices maturity models. This article explores the significance of shifting left in microservices adoption, its benefits, challenges, and practical considerations for organizations embarking on this journey.

# Understanding Shifting Left

Shifting left refers to the concept of integrating activities such as testing, security, and compliance earlier in the software development lifecycle. Traditionally, these activities are performed closer to the end of the development process. However, by shifting them left, thus closer to dev cycles, organizations can identify and address issues sooner, thus reducing the likelihood of costly errors and delays downstream.

# The Role of Microservices Maturity Models

Maturity models for microservices provide a framework for assessing an organization's engineering quality and maturity along the microservices adoption and architectures axis'. By incorporating these maturity models early in the development lifecycle, teams can align their practices with North Star architectures and practices, and this will help the teams identify areas for improvement, establish a roadmap for success, because the metrics will provide reasonable arguments to product and engineering leadership for the for spend on capacity, but ultimately, it gives the team autonomomy to maintain their own services.

# Benefits of Early Adoption

Early adoption of microservices maturity models offers several benefits. Firstly, it promotes a culture of continuous improvement, where teams are encouraged to iterate and refine their processes over time. Secondly, it enables teams to address potential issues proactively, reducing the risk of costly rework and delays. Finally, it lays the foundation for scalability and resilience, ensuring that microservices architectures can evolve and adapt to changing business requirements.

# Challenges and Considerations

While the benefits of shifting left with early microservices maturity adoption are clear, it's not without its challenges. Organizations must navigate cultural resistance, overcome technical hurdles, and invest in the necessary tools and training to support this transition. Additionally, they must strike a balance between agility and governance, ensuring that development teams have the autonomy to innovate while adhering to organizational standards and compliance requirements.

In engineering cultures, "shifting left" is referred to as an overused and meaningless buzz word:

# Conclusion

In conclusion, shifting left with early adoption of microservices maturity models offers organizations a strategic advantage in today's competitive landscape. By integrating microservices maturity assessments into the development lifecycle from the outset, teams can accelerate time-to-market, improve product quality, and drive innovation. While challenges exist, the long-term benefits of this approach far outweigh the initial investment, making it a worthwhile endeavor for organizations committed to excellence in software development.
